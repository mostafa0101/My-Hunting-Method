### 1- Recon
    - First testing the app as a normal user & the source code then map the app in notes 
    - Everything i can't do as a normal user is a possible Bug as a Hunter
    
### 2- Asking myself?

        - What Could hurt this app?
        - what language or framework is used?
        - Is there Authentication ?
        - What about sessions ?
        - How is a user identified ?
        - Are there multiple user roles ?
        - What about the company's GitHub acc ?
        - How the API works ?
        - What about the CRUD and request methods and what operations is done in every page ?
        
        Then take a Deep Dive into the app to see what can be done depending on the app's functions  

### 3- Auth attacks
    - Testing Any Auth entry by some scenarios i collected from many writeups, POC's and manual testing
    - Create two accounts victim & attacker and try different scenarios between both (IDOR, BAC, PrivEsc...etc) 

### 4- Functions
    -  Go through the whole app functions & try to get any business logic bug that go against the app functions

### 5- Injections
    - First try manual injection then the automative injection (XSS, SQLi, XXE, Command injection)

### 6- Some help
    - Some times i use BugCrowd [VRT](www.bugcrowd.com/vulnerability-rating-taxonomy) to get ideas of Bugs to Hunt on
