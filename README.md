# My Approach 
  (my poor approach) 
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1- Recon
  - First testing the app as a normal user then use my arsenal to collect subdomains and files 
    
### 2- Auth attacks
  - Testing Any Auth entry by some scenarios i collected from many writeups, POC's and manual testing
  - Create two accounts victim & attacker and try different scenarios between both (IDOR, BAC..etc) 

### 3- Functions
  - Go through the whole app functions & try to get any business logic bug that go against the app funcs

### 4- Injections
  - First try manual injection then the automative injection (XSS, SQLi, XXE, Command injection)
