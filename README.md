### 1- Recon
    - First testing the app as a normal user & the source code then use my arsenal to collect subdomains and files 
    
### 2- Asking myself?
   
        - what language or framework is used?
        - Is there Authentication ?
        - What about sessions ?
        - How is a user identified ?
        - Are there multiple user roles ?
        - What about the company's GitHub acc ?
        - How the API works ?
        - What about the CRUD and request methods and what operations is done in every page ?
        
        Then take a Deep Dive into the app to see what can be done depending on the app's functions  

    
### 3- Auth attacks
    - Testing Any Auth entry by some scenarios i collected from many writeups, POC's and manual testing
    - Create two accounts victim & attacker and try different scenarios between both (IDOR, BAC..etc) 

### 4- Functions
    -  Go through the whole app functions & try to get any business logic bug that go against the app funcs

### 5- Injections
    - First try manual injection then the automative injection (XSS, SQLi, XXE, Command injection)
